Ask how the implementation of async works for ariadne. Let's say there's a sleep function, does it have to be asyncio.sleep?

No need to use a future thing, run gather

Check if a member exists Redis:

Here I've added three elements to my set and told Redis to return all the elements. As you can see they are not sorted -- Redis is free to return the elements in any order at every call, since there is no contract with the user about element ordering.

Redis has commands to test for membership. For example, checking if an element exists: https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro

> sismember myset 3
(integer) 1
> sismember myset 30
(integer) 0
